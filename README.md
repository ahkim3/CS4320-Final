In order to run our project, you need to build both the Dockerfile in the "server" directory as well as the "project" directory

for the server image use
docker run -p 5555:5555 <image id>

for the project image use
docker run -p 8080:19006 <image id>

after that, open the frontend on localhost:8080, and that should give you the project
